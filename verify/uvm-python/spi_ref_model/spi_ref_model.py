    """
    The reference model is a crucial element within the top-level verification environment, designed to validate the functionality and performance of both the IP (Intellectual Property) and the bus system. Its primary role is to act as a representative or mimic of the actual hardware components, including the IP and the bus. Key features and functions of the reference model include:
    1) Input Simulation: The reference model is capable of receiving the same inputs that would be provided to the actual IP and bus via connection with the monitors of the bus and IP.
    2) Functional Emulation: It emulates the behavior and responses of the IP and bus under test. By replicating the operational characteristics of these components, the reference model serves as a benchmark for expected performance and behavior.
    3) Output Generation: Upon receiving inputs, the reference model processes them in a manner akin to the real hardware, subsequently generating expected outputs. These outputs are essential for comparison in the verification process.
    4) Interface with Scoreboard: The outputs from the reference model, representing the expected results, are forwarded to the scoreboard. The scoreboard then compares these expected results with the actual outputs from the IP and bus for verification.
    5)Register Abstraction Layer (RAL) Integration: The reference model includes a RAL model that mirrors the register values of the RTL, ensuring synchronization between expected and actual register states. This model facilitates register-level tests and error detection, offering accessible and up-to-date register values for other verification components. It enhances the automation and coverage of register testing, playing a vital role in ensuring the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the verification process.
