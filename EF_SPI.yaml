  firmware_guidelines: |
    1. Set the prescaler by writing to the ``PR`` register where SPI Clock Frequency = System Clock / PR. Note: should have a value >= 2.
    2. Configure clock polarity and clock phase bu setting ``cpol`` and ``cpha`` fields in the ``CFG`` register.
    3. Set the ``SSn`` field in the ``CTRL`` register
